I turned in my keys and left my position to make time for my priorities: web design, graphic design, and developing my professional skills. It wasn't an easy decision for me, leaving a money-making job to focus on other things, things which may or may not take many months to show any results. But I'm already glad that I'm making this change."

<p class="post-content">Yesterday was my last day working at a local small business in the East Bay. I turned in my keys and left my position to make time for my priorities: web design, graphic design, and developing my professional skills. It wasn't an easy decision for me, leaving a money-making job to focus on other things, things which may or may not take many months to show any results. But I'm already glad that I'm making this change.</p>
<br/>
<p class="post-content">I began my professional career as an English major, spending my first few years trying to find a job (any job!) where I could put my skills and interests to good use. As other BAS majors know, you sometimes have to take what you can get and hope it turns into something more. Even though I did find a few jobs I enjoyed, in the back of my mind I always felt they were only temporary.</p>
<br/>
<p class="post-content">I don't expect to become success overnight, but I'm so excited to learn and work for more. It feels good to try new things that I'm not yet familiar with - the field is slightly intimidating, and I often feel like there is an endless amount of learning to do. But I'm up for the challenge! I recently read a great article on the <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/zach-leatherman/2014-June-7" target="blank">Imposter Syndrome</a>, which helps me get going on days when I'm less than excited.</p>
<br/>
<p class="post-content">Thanks for indulging me. What professional risks are you glad you took?
