description: "I started out editing photos in Photoshop using the Adjustment features. They're great for turning ho-hum photos into brighter, more vivid /img with a greater range of tones. Another way to manually get this effect is to use the Brush tool and add specific colors to your photos in places where they could use more dimension."

<p class="post-content">I started out editing photos in Photoshop  using the Adjustment features. They're great for turning ho-hum photos into brighter, more vivid /img with a greater range of tones. Another way to manually get this effect is to use the Brush tool and add specific colors to your photos in places where they could use more dimension.</p>
<br/>
<p class="post-content">This is my starting image. It was taken on a beautiful day at Muir Beach in Marin County, CA, but the photo came out very dull. The colors are washed-out and desaturated, and I wanted to give it more life.</p>
<br/>

<p class="post-content">I used a round, soft brush to paint colors over my image. For each color, I added a new layer so I could toggle the visibility off and on to see if I liked the way the image looked after each color. Set each new layer to Soft Light, and adjust the opacity based on how strong you want the color to be. I also grouped these layers together once I was happy with the result. These are the color layers.</p>

<p class="post-content">There are a total of five layers, which add brighter colors to the beach scene. My favorite trick is to use white to highlight - I did this on the hills and rock faces where the sun is shining, and along the beach at the brightest part.</p>

<p class="post-content">The final image is slightly more vibrant, and the hills are still a little dark, but I like that it doesn't look overly manipulated. This is a good technique to use on vacation photos that don't quite capture the mood of a day and just need a slight adjustment.</p>
<br/>
<p class="post-content">Have you gotten good results with this technique?
