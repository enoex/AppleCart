<p class="post-content">There are a few different ways to get your footer to stay put. This is a bare-bones, no-fuss way to get your very own Sticky Footer.</p>

<ol class="post-content">
    <li>Give html and body a height of 100%.</li>
    <li>Wrap your content in a div with a class of “content-wrapper” (or anything you want) and give the class a min-height: 100%, and margin-bottom: -130px (or however tall you want your footer to be).</li>
    <li>Give your footer a height of 130px (the positive value  of your “content-wrapper” margin-bottom).</li>
    <li>Use the universal selector * to set all margins to 0. This will get rid of the whitespace around your elements and divs, bringing your content to the edges of the window.</li>
