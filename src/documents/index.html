        <p class="post-content">This weekend I launched my travel website, <a href="http://dreamingca.com" target="blank">Dreaming California</a>. I’m so excited to share this project, which incorporates a few new layout techniques I’ve been experimenting with, including flexbox and a scalable, responsive image carousel from <a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" target="blank">Slick</a>. You can also follow my new <a href="http://instagram.com/dreamingca" target="blank">Instagram</a>, where I’ll be keeping up with the website travel log. I love to hear suggestions to add to my wish list of new places to see - if you have any California favorites let me know! <a href="http://twitter.com/alisen_hazzard" target="blank">@alisen_hazzard</a></p>

        <p class="post-content">When I start making a website, the first problem I run into is creating a sticky footer. All I want is for my footer to stay at the bottom of the page, right from the get-go, so I don’t have to worry about it while I structure the rest of the page.

        <p class="post-content">I started out editing photos in Photoshop  using the Adjustment features. They're great for turning ho-hum photos into brighter, more vivid images with a greater range of tones. Another way to manually get this effect is to use the Brush tool and add specific colors to your photos in places where they could use more demension<a href="/blog#painting" title="Read More">[...]</a></p>

    <p class="post-content">Here's a fun and quick effect in Photoshop - it uses only three layers and takes no time at all. I like it because you can adjust the size of the pixels and get different results, depending on how much of the original image you want to remain when you're done<a href="/blog#pix-image" title="Read More">[...]</a></p>

    <p class="post-content">One of my new favorite ways to use Illustrator is as a tracing tool. As a kid, I would trace coloring book pages for my friends so we could all color the same pictures together (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lisa+frank&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=zCqbU9zGCZKqyATJ6YKoDg&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1350&bih=713#q=lisa+frank+coloring+pages&tbm=isch&imgdii=_" target="blank">Lisa Frank</a>, anyone?).
